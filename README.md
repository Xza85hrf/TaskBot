TaskBot is a task automation tool built using Python and tkinter. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for scripting and executing automated actions such as mouse clicks, keystrokes, and more. The tool is available in two versions: Basic and Advanced, catering to different user needs and complexity levels.

## Features

**TaskBot_Basic**:
- Load and execute actions from a JSON file.
- Basic GUI for action management.
- Execute automated tasks like mouse clicks, keyboard actions, etc.

**TaskBot_Advanced**:
- All features of the Basic version.
- Ability to save and manage actions in a JSON file through the GUI.
- Enhanced error handling and validation of user inputs.
